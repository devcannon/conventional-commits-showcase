# conventional-commits-showcase
Showcase of conventional commits and tooling for creating changelogs

## `cog` command line toolkit
This repo showcases the benefits of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification) in combination with [cog](https://docs.cocogitto.io/guide/#repository-initialization)

# Usage of `cog` command line tooling
- Use `cog commit` to create a conventional commit
- Use `cog check` to check if all commits are conventional commits
- Use `cog bump --auto` to bump the version
- Use `cog changelog` to generate a change log
  - TODO: Compare with git-cliff

# Characteristics of version bump with cog
- The version tag is created
- The changelog is generated and stored to a file
